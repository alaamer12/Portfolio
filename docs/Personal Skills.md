# Personal Skills

## Team Types:

### 1. Self-Driven Team (High Initiative, High Motivation)

**Traits:** They’re proactive, they look for responsibility, they push themselves and the project forward.

**Leadership Need**: Enablement. Your role here is less about “driving” and more about removing blockers, providing vision, and recognizing their efforts.

### 2. Driven Team (Low Initiative, Responsive Motivation)

**Traits:** They don’t move until pushed, but once pushed, they execute reliably. They need external motivation (deadlines, encouragement, or accountability). 

**Leadership Need:** Active drive. You need to be present—setting goals, checking in, creating momentum.

### 3. Non-Working Team (Resistant, Low Motivation)

**Traits:** They resist direction, avoid responsibility, and may even undermine progress (complaining, disengaging, blaming). 

**Leadership Need:** Diagnosis + tough decisions. Sometimes they’re disengaged due to unclear vision, mismatched skills, or external stress—but sometimes they simply won’t work no matter what.

## Experiences

## 1st Year

**No projects for First year, both s**emesters.

---

## 2nd Year – First Semester

**Introduction to Information Systems (Java, Documentation) – Pharmacy Project**

We were a team of 5. I was just a member, new to everything. I wasn’t cooperative, and sadly, I didn’t contribute to the code at all. We were inexperienced, and we couldn’t manage to work as a team.

I know i did wrong when i decided just to watch, I'm now understand the leader disappointment feeling.

- **Role:** Member
- **Team Size:** 5
- **Team Type:** Non-Working Team
- **Contribution:** None
- **Feeling:** Lost, insecure, uncooperative, regret, sorrow
- **Lesson:** Being passive destroys both you and the team and the trust bond

---

**Logic Design (PCB Design, Proteus) – System Vote Project**

We were 4 members, strangers to each other, and none of us knew much about the subject. It was hell. Very hard for us.

But I tried. I tried *very* hard until I managed to understand the subject and become capable of working with it. In the end, I did **100% of the work**. None of them contributed—only excuses like: *“If I knew, I could help you, but I don’t.”*

This was one of the worst projects. I was the leader, but I carried it alone.

The only reason the made me do 100% of the work because of my grade, i needed these marks.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 4
- **Team Type:** Non-Working Team
- **Contribution:** 100% (solo)
- **Feeling:** Overloaded, betrayed, frustrated
- **Lesson:** Carrying everything alone burns you out

---

## 2nd Year – Second Semester

**System Analysis and Design (Documentation) – Time Tracking Project**

We were 2 in this project, and he was my friend. Since it was just the two of us, we managed to split the work fairly: 50%/50%. It was great.

- **Role:** Member (equal partner)
- **Team Size:** 2
- **Contribution:** 50%
- **Feeling:** Balanced, satisfied
- **Lesson:** Equal teamwork works beautifully, small teams make working equally more possibly

---

**Computer Architecture (Verilog) – No Name Project**

We were 3. I was the leader, but I was bad. I had no vision, gave no clear commands. I mostly listened, thought a little, and just agreed. I managed to decompose the work, but unequally—I did 60%, the other two did 40%. This was my mistake, because I didn’t trust them. It wasn’t that they were untrustworthy, but I had trust issues—especially when it came to women.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 3
- **Team Type:** Driven Team
- **Contribution:** 60%
- **Feeling:** Hesitant, distrustful, regretful
- **Lesson:** Leadership needs vision and trust and communication

---

## Internship

**ChitChat Project (Python, Documentation)**

We were 6 or 7 members. It was a Python project for building an application with a database. Because I knew Python best, I was chosen as leader.

But we couldn’t manage to work as a team. They were my friends, so they were willing to help, but I couldn’t organize them. We ended up using PyCharm’s “code with me” feature, all on a single Meet call. I was the only one writing code while they communicated with me through the call. In the end, I wrote most of the project.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 6–7
- **Team Type:** Driven Team (Because they were willing to communicate in meetings)
- **Contribution:** ~85% (majority coding)
- **Feeling:** Pressured, unorganized, isolated, immatures
- **Lesson:** Friendship ≠ teamwork; leadership requires structure

---

## 3rd Year – First Semester

**Computer Vision (Python, Mediapipe, YOLO) – Tasks, not a full project**

I joined older students, so I had no choice but to work solo. I did everything alone. No regrets—I did it perfectly and got full marks, even with a bonus.

I admit, it was very hard at the beginning, this whole thing was totally new, i had to work more than any student, but i did it, and I'm glad.

- **Role:** Solo
- **Team Size:** 1
- **Team Type: Solo**
- **Contribution:** 100%
- **Feeling:** Proud, empowered, glad
- **Lesson:** Working alone can be rewarding if you’re skilled

---

**Image Processing (Python, MATLAB) – Tasks + Improcess Project**

We were a team of 5 or 6. We studied over 30 algorithms and their implementations. In the project, I started to become a better leader. I organized the work into tasks: Member A does this, Member B does that. It wasn’t perfectly fair, but it worked.

In the end, I wrote the full project in Python. Unexpectedly, another member also did the full project in MATLAB. So, we had two versions. I can’t say the project went bad. I was the leader.

I have to admit this member who did another project version increased our surviving rate in the assessment

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 5–6
- **Team Type:** Driven Team
- **Contribution:** Major (Python version)
- **Feeling:** Improving, hopeful
- **Lesson:** Leadership improves with task delegation; some members can rise in hard situation with their own vision

---

**Robotics (Python, C++, ROS, Gazebo) – Maze Car Project**

Team of 5. This was chaotic. We all hated the subject because ROS and Gazebo were difficult and slow, and we had to work on a virtual machine. I tried to decompose the work, but failed—every plan collapsed when requirements had changed.

I did my best, but it wasn’t enough. As leader, I was too democratic, accepting every opinion, even when it ruined the plan.

I learned here that being *a little dictatorial* isn’t bad. Sometimes you need to believe in your decision—you might be right in the end.

In the end the project failed

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 5
- **Team Type:** Non-Working Team
- **Contribution:** Major effort, no clear outcome
- **Feeling:** Frustrated, indecisive, reflective, indifferent [in this point i was not caring anymore]
- **Lesson:** Leadership requires confidence, not only democracy

---

**Software Engineering (Documentation, UML) – AI Therapist**

Team of 5. We had to create UML diagrams and full documentation. I was the leader, but the project idea wasn’t mine. I struggled to understand it, so I couldn’t deliver a perfect outcome.

The tasks were easy to divide: each person did one diagram or one documentation section. It worked fairly. In the end, it wasn’t a bad project, but not great either.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 5
- **Team Type:** Driven Team
- **Contribution:** Shared fairly
- **Feeling:** Neutral, disconnected
- **Lesson:** If the idea doesn’t inspire you, leadership feels heavy

---

## 3rd Year – Second Semester

By this semester, I was more mature. I understood more, and I knew how to handle different situations. But not fully matured yet.

**Computer Graphics (C++, OpenGL) – Artspace Project**

I decided not to choose random teammates anymore. Instead, I picked people I trusted. We were 3. One member did nothing, just wanted to cheat. I accepted him only because he felt sad being ditched, but I excluded him from real work.

In the end, me and M. completed a fully impressive project, just the two of us.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 3 (but real contributors = 2)
- **Team Type:** Driven Team + Non-Working Team (Because of this member)
- **Contribution:** 50% (shared with M)
- **Feeling:** Relief, trust, pride
- **Lesson:** Choose teammates wisely, pity ≠ team member

---

**Machine Learning (Python) – Tasks, not a full project**

Team of 5. I was not the leader. But the team disbanded after one week, and everyone ended up doing tasks individually.

- **Role:** Member
- **Team Size:** 5 (disbanded)
- **Team Type: Sole**
- **Contribution:** Solo tasks
- **Feeling:** Disappointed, detached
- **Lesson:** Not all teams survive; wrong leader can destroy team not rescue it

---

**Neural Networks (Python) – Fragma Project**

We were 3, but the new member contributed nothing—just excuses and congratulations. Once again, only me and M. did the full project.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 3 (real contributors = 2)
- **Team Type:** Driven Team + Non-Working Team (Because of this member)
- **Contribution:** 50% (shared with M)
- **Feeling:** Annoyed, resigned
- **Lesson:** Some people never contribute, even when included

---

**NLP (Python) – Fragma Project**

Same team of 3. Same story: me and M. carried it, while the third did nothing.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 3 (real contributors = 2)
- **Team Type:** Driven Team + Non-Working Team (Because of this member)
- **Contribution:** 50% (shared with M)
- **Feeling:** Frustrated, repetitive
- **Lesson:** Don’t repeat mistakes with unreliable teammates

---

**Robotics (Python) – Pysolver Project**

Same team again. This time, the non-contributing member did *about 10%* of the work. Hurray, I guess.

I mean he did it before our assessment by one minute, what do i expect, A good quality, nah it was so sloppy

I was ready to omit him before the professor and say, “I and M. did this work, and this part was belonging to ‘This someone’ but he did nothing; So, it is your call”.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 3
- **Team Type:** Driven Team + Non-Working Team (Because of this member)
- **Contribution:** Me & M (90%), third member (10%)
- **Feeling:** Not feeling pity anymore upon those who do not contribute, satisfied.
- **Lesson:** Even minimal contribution is not acceptable

---

**VR & AR (C#, Unity) – DrumVerse Project**

Team of 5. I hated this project more than any other. I tried everything: meetings, decomposing tasks, warning them about risks, pushing them forward. But they didn’t listen. Their only answer was: *“We can handle it later.”*

When “later” came, of course, nothing was done. They didn’t trust my experience, didn’t contribute, ignored my guidance—even though I prepared step-by-step instructions that a beginner could follow.

In the end, I did **98% of the project myself**. At one point, I worked **15 hours continuously—without eating, without resting, barely blinking—just to finish it in time.** The stress was crushing.

When it came to documentation, I asked them to at least handle that, since I had done all the coding. What did I get? A sloppy document made in 20 minutes, worse than what a child could produce. I was furious.

- **Role:** Leader
- **Team Size:** 5 (real contributor = 1)
- **Team Type:** Non-Working Team
- **Contribution:** 98%
- **Feeling:** Exhausted, furious, betrayed, broken,
- **Lesson Learned**: Wrong teammates can destroy you, no matter how strong you are. I realized it’s wise to always have a *backup boat*. When people insist *“We’ll move the rudder later”*, let them sail their doomed ship—and watch it sink—while you save yourself and your vision.

## Graduation Project Team Formation Website (3rd Year – Second Semester)

**Situation:**

During the second semester of my 3rd year, our **Student Consultant Leader (SCL)** was overwhelmed. We needed to form graduation project teams, but communication relied on her manually forwarding requests to the semester group. This caused **message chaos**: requests got lost, replies delayed, and everyone became frustrated.

**Task:**

I recognized the need for a **systematic solution** that could handle requests directly, reduce the burden on the SCL, and make the process transparent. My responsibility became to design, implement, and maintain a platform to fix this communication problem.

**Action:**

- Proposed the idea of a **website** to the SCL, who agreed.
- Designed and developed a **Fullstack platform** where:
    - Students seeking a team could post requests.
    - Teams needing members could list their openings.
- Deployed the system and opened it to students.
- When a **critical synchronization bug** appeared (database & caching conflict), I:
    - Immediately switched the system into **maintenance mode**.
    - Debugged the issue intensively for ~6 hours.
    - Implemented and redeployed a stable fix.

**Result:**

- The platform was adopted by many students, easing the SCL’s workload.
- Team formation became **faster and more organized**, reducing miscommunication drastically.
- I learned the importance of having a **maintenance and monitoring plan** after deployment.
- This experience reinforced my ability to combine **technical leadership with problem-solving under pressure**.

---

### Reflection

The system ran smoothly afterward, and the trust in both me and the tool grew stronger.

- **Role:** Creator / Fullstack Developer
- **Team Size:** 1 (solo initiative, but serving the whole semester)
- **Team Type:** Self-Driven Action (personal initiative to fix team communication)
- **Contribution:** 100% (design, development, deployment, crisis fix)
- **Feeling:** Proud, responsible, tested under pressure
- **Lesson:** Leadership isn’t always direct—it can be about building tools that enable teams to work better. But technical leadership also requires foresight: a **maintenance plan is as important as the launch**.

## 4th Year – Present

**Project Leadership (Multiple Technologies) – Structured Team Phase**

This semester marked a turning point. For the first time, I constructed my team *very wisely*, handpicking members based on reliability and complementing skills instead of chance.

I established **clear communication channels** (via Slack) and enforced a *single source of truth* through well-written documentation. No more relying on vague talk—if something was unclear, the document spoke.

I scheduled **fixed weekly meetings** (and more when needed) to maintain accountability and momentum. I assigned tasks, set deadlines, tracked progress, and evaluated performance. Beyond management, I also focused on **motivation and comfort**—balancing authority with empathy.

This wasn’t just about finishing a project. It was about building a *culture of teamwork*. For the first time, I felt I wasn’t just carrying work or managing chaos—I was **conducting a team like an orchestra**, where every member contributed in harmony.

---

## DEPI Training (Government Program, Data Engineering Track)

Because of my strong programming background—especially in Python—I was often consulted by both peers and the instructor. The instructor even suggested I act as an informal *assistant instructor* to support others struggling with Python concepts (even simple things like lambda functions were challenging for them).

I took this seriously: I scheduled extra sessions, reminded the group, and even created polls for the best time. About 10 people confirmed they would come. But when I held the open session, I waited **1 hour 40 minutes** and not a single one joined. Even those who briefly opened the room left instantly. Not even the group leader showed up.

I didn’t complain to the instructor because I didn’t want to seem like I was “crying” or forcing anyone. Still, I was deeply disappointed. I wasn’t doing this for recognition—I could have easily ignored their struggles and let them fail—but I wanted them to succeed.

Later, I tried again—but this time with a **smaller group of 5**. That changed everything. They admitted they had previously ignored me because they thought my knowledge was “useless” or “not beneficial.” But after engaging in the smaller group, they realized the opposite. Slowly, the group began to trust me, and from there it started to grow naturally.

- **Role:** Informal Instructor Assistant
- **Team Size:** Initially ~20–23, later reduced to 5
- **Team Type:** Transition from Non-Working Team → Driven Team (once trust was built)
- **Contribution:** Organized extra teaching sessions, restructured group into smaller setting, built trust
- **Feeling:** First: disappointed, undervalued → Later: hopeful, validated, encouraged
- **Lesson:** Leadership isn’t just about offering help—it’s about **earning trust first**. Without trust, even the best effort is ignored. With trust, even small initiatives can grow into something meaningful.

---

### Project PixCrawler – A Turning Point

From this growth, I was chosen to join a team of **6 members** to work on the **PixCrawler project**. These are the members who *trusted me*.

What I noticed immediately is that this team is **Self-Driven**. They don’t wait to be pushed. Instead:

- They ask me for more sessions.
- They respect my knowledge.
- They wait for me to join before starting.

For the first time in this journey, I feel deeply satisfied—like my years of effort weren’t ruined. The struggles, the rejections, the burnouts, the lessons—all of it led to this moment: a team that doesn’t just tolerate my leadership but actively **wants** it.

- **Role:** Team Member (Trusted Contributor / Emerging Leader)
- **Team Size:** 6
- **Team Type:** Self-Driven Team
- **Contribution:** Early mentoring, guidance, project initiation
- **Feeling:** Satisfied, validated, hopeful
- **Lesson:** When trust is earned and the right people gather, leadership transforms from pushing a heavy load to guiding a willing force.

---

### The Unexpected with M.

Throughout 3rd year, I had successfully managed many projects with **M.**. He consistently followed my guidance, contributed when directed, and helped us succeed together. Because of that strong partnership, I naturally chose him again in 4th year.

But unexpectedly, he became the **bottleneck**. His work was sloppy—so much so that, even though I had no prior experience in UI/UX, I could have done the tasks *10x better*. He offered excuses, stopped communicating, didn’t respond to messages, and showed disrespect by his actions for the process we had built.

This stunned me. He felt like a totally different person. I kept wondering:

- Did something personal happen (trauma, stress)?
- Was it because he shifted focus from Python into UI/UX (his actual specialty), but somehow performed worse?
- Did he develop a problem with me or with the team?

So far, I’m still trying to **fix this situation** and understand what caused the shift. It taught me a hard truth: *even the most reliable teammates from the past can unexpectedly fail in the present*. Trust must be renewed continuously, not assumed forever.

**Deeper Lesson:**

This experience with M. revealed one of the hardest truths I’ve learned so far: people are not fixed roles in your story. A bad teammate today might surprise you tomorrow with growth, while a good teammate today might fall into excuses or decline. Leadership, therefore, is not about labeling people once and forever—it’s about constantly re-evaluating, re-engaging, and adapting to who they are *right now*

---

- **Role:** Leader (Conductor)
- **Team Size:** Chosen carefully
- **Team Type:** Driven Team
- **Contribution:** Structured delegation, oversight, guidance
- **Feeling:** Confident in process, but stunned and confused by M.’s shift
- **Lesson:** True leadership is about ***engineering the environment**: clear communication, structured delegation, and balanced empathy make the team succeed together*, but also about staying flexible when people change. Past reliability does not guarantee future contribution.

---

I learnt also it is important to have at least one supporter between the teammates, because the team mates sometimes they do not trust you, but this teammate can give them hope, by accepting your guidance

so it is hard to be totally solo

---

## Reflection

- In the beginning, I was passive, uncooperative, and contributed little.
- Later, I overcompensated: I carried entire projects myself, often burning out, unable to trust or delegate.
- Slowly, I grew into leadership—learning task decomposition, accountability, and the need to balance democracy with authority.
- I learned that sometimes being firm, even dictatorial, is necessary.
- I also learned that teammates matter more than the subject itself: bad teammates drag you down, good teammates lift you up.
- The best experiences came when work was shared fairly, or when I worked with someone I trusted (like M).
- The worst experiences came when I was left alone to carry everything—like in the VR project, where stress pushed me to the edge.
- I grow step by step and breaks students’ leadership into real leadership
