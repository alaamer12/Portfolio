## Portfolio & Personal Website Guidelines

### 🎨 Design & Theming

-   Avoid **dark-only themes** — always support both light and dark modes for accessibility.
    
-   Minimize the use of **many colors**. A clean, consistent palette improves readability.
    
-   Prioritize **readability and clarity** over flashy design.
    

### 📂 Project Cards & Showcases

-   Project cards should be **interactive**:
    
    -   Clickable to navigate to the project.
        
    -   Display extra info (e.g., a summary) on hover.
        
-   Avoid **duplicate project names** — each project should feel unique.
    
-   For every project:
    
    -   Add a **short description** (1–2 sentences, clear and professional).
        
    -   Show **tools & technologies as tags**.
        
        -   Example: `React` · `Node.js` · `MongoDB`
            
        -   Each tag should be **clickable** (leading to official docs or your related work).
            
-   Even if projects are private or under NDA, **mention them** (without details). Use phrases like:  
    _“What happens in Cupertino stays in Cupertino.”_

    

### 👤 Personal Branding

-   Use **one strong hero image** at most. Avoid multiple personal photos.
    
-   A **demo face-shot video (≤40s)** is a good addition if authentic and professional.
    
-   If using profile images, **blob-shaped framing** works well, but it’s optional.
    

### 📞 Contact & Networking

-   Having multiple **“Contact Me” buttons** is good — makes it easier for visitors.
    
-   Ensure all **contact details are clickable** (phone → dialer, email → mail client, etc.).
    
-   Add a **direct contact form** to avoid forcing users to open Gmail/Outlook.
    
-   Provide professional links:
    
    -   LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, Twitter (with latest icons), Phone (international format).
        
-   Location is optional — it’s just context.
    

### 📑 Content Guidelines

-   **About section**:
    
    -   Don’t include it unless it’s well-written.
        
    -   When included, use **USP (Unique Selling Proposition)** and **storytelling techniques**.
        
    -   Choose **context-smart words** (e.g., for a marriage counselor, “I do” is clever).
        
-   Avoid “Contact me to learn more.” → Instead: “Contact me to start building your project.”
    
-   Be specific:
    
    -   Bad: “I’m a fullstack.”
        
    -   Good: “I’m a fullstack developer specializing in web apps with JavaScript and Node.js.”
        

### 📊 Skills & Experience

-   Avoid **percentage-based skill bars** — they’re misleading.
    
-   Don’t list **soft skills** — focus on hard, verifiable skills.
    
-   **Language skills** are not important unless directly relevant to your work.
    
-   Always keep skills, projects, and services **updated**.
    
-   Use a **Timeline component** (with dates) to showcase career history.
    

### 🏆 Professional Additions

-   Add **work experience** if available.
    
-   List **offered services** clearly.
    
-   Showcase **achievements** (awards, certifications, contributions).
    
-   Include **testimonials** if possible (ensure they’re genuine).

✨ In short: Keep it professional, simple, and story-driven. Your portfolio should **sell your expertise without clutter**.
